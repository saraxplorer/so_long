Pointer Implementation:
t_game *game // Declare a pointer to a t_game structure
game->map = blabla
The arrow operator is used to access struct member through the pointer.

Structure Variable Implementation:
t_game game; // Declare a t_game structure variable
game.map = bla bla
The dot operator is used to directly access the member of the struct.
